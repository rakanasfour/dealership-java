Dealership Application with Spring Boot
Welcome to the Dealership Application, a robust and efficient system built using the Spring Boot framework. This application is designed to streamline interactions between the front end and the database, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

Overview
The application is structured into three key layers, each serving a specific purpose:

Controller Layer (RESTful API Service):

This layer acts as the interface between the application and the front end. It handles incoming requests, making the application easily accessible to users. RESTful principles are followed to ensure a clear and standardized API.
Service Layer:

The service layer is responsible for data manipulation and houses any mathematical logic required by the application. It ensures that the core functionality of the application is executed efficiently and accurately.
Database Interaction Layer:

The final layer is dedicated to passing data to and from the database. It manages the storage and retrieval of information, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
